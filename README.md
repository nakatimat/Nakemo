👋 Hi, I’m Matheus Nakati — aka Nakemo | Creator of NakeVerso

🎮 Solo Indie Game Developer • 💻 Web Developer • 🎶 Musician • 🎥 Content Creator

I’m a multidisciplinary creator passionate about building immersive digital experiences — from modern web applications to emotional, atmospheric indie games.
At the moment, I’m working as a solo Web Developer for a company, constantly improving my skills and expanding my technical range. Even so, my most refined expertise comes from years of developing games in Unity (C#), a skill proudly endorsed on my LinkedIn.

On NakeVerso, my YouTube channel, I share my journey in game development, creativity, and the chaos of making ideas real — one project at a time.

💻 Build and maintain web applications professionally
🎵 Compose music and soundscapes for my own projects
🎥 Produce content focused on game development, creativity & tech
